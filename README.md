# Pathfinding-Experiment
Mini-project: Pathfinding Experiment on Unity

This Mini-Project was built as part of my CSC 4301 Intro. to Artificial Intelligence Course under the supervision of Dr. Tajjeeddine Rachidi.

The purpose of this program is to experiment with 4 different graph search algorithms for pathfinding, those being Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), 
Uniform Cost Search based on Djikstra's Algorithm (UCS), and lastly A* search. These algorithms were implemented in the same way, with the only differences between them being
the fringe strategy and the heuristics function.

How to run:

1. Download Unity3d
2. Clone the repository in a folder.
3. Open that folder in Unity3d as a project.
4. Run the project from a debug tool in Unity3d.

The C# code for this project is located under "Assets/Scripts".
